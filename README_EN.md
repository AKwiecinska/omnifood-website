# Omnifood Website Portfolio

This repository contains the Omnifood website project that I created as part of my course and serves as a portfolio showcasing my web development skills.

Omnifood is a fictional company offering healthy and delicious meal delivery services. The website aims to present the company's products and services in an attractive and interactive way.

## The key features of the Omnifood Website project are:

**1. Responsive design:** The website has been designed to be fully responsive and visually appealing on various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers.

**2. Engaging interface:** I have applied modern styles, animations, and effects to give the website a professional look and make it enjoyable for users.

**3. Intuitive navigation:** The website has been optimized for easy navigation, allowing users to quickly find information and place meal orders.

**4. Order form:** I have implemented an order form that enables users to conveniently place orders directly on the website.

**5. Standards compliance:** The project has been developed following best practices and adhering to the latest web standards.


The repository includes the complete source code, CSS files, images, and other necessary resources for deploying the Omnifood website.

By showcasing this project, I demonstrate my skills in web design and development, as well as the experience gained during my course. I invite you to explore the project and discover the various features implemented in the Omnifood website.
